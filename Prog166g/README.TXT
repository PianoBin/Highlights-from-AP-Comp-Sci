Program 166g
(Bermuda triangle)

Program Description:  Write a program that accepts a number of rows between 2 and 10.  Produce a multiplication triangle of n rows.  Each row contains entries up to its row size (i.e row 3 will have the values 1X3, 2X3, 3X3, row 4 will have the values 1X4,2X4,3X4,4X4).

The program will initially print a multiplication triangle of 4 rows as an example for the user.  The program will then prompts the user to enter the number of rows to be displayed.  If the user enters "0" as a "number of rows"  this will serve as a sentinel value and terminate the program with an "acceptable" message.


When you are finished submit the completed program in your course drop box.

Statements Required:  input, properly formatted output, loop control ( a DO...WHILE loop must be used to determine if the user wishes to continue)
