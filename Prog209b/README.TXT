Program 209b
(throwing three dice)

Program Description:  There is a belief among dice players that in throwing three dice a ten is easier to get than a nine.  Can you write a program that proves or disproves this belief?

Have the computer compute all the possible ways three dice can be thrown: 1 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 2, 1 + 1 + 3, etc.  Add up each of these possibilities and see how many give nine as the result and how many give ten.  If more give ten, then the belief is proven.
