Program Description:  Write a program that simulates the guessing game “Higher/Lower”.  The computer will generate a number between 1 and 100 inclusive.  The user will be asked to guess the number.  If the guess is incorrect the program will give a clue of whether the guess was too high or too low and asks the user to guess again.  This procedure continues until the user finally guesses the correct number.  The program will also keep track of and print out the number of guess it took before the user guessed the correct number.
