Program 213d
(Weather Forecasting)

Program Description: It is a belief by some that the common field cricket chirps are in direct proportion to the current temperature.  To get the temperature in Fahrenheit, add 40 to the number of times a cricket chirps in a minute and divide by 4.

Write a program that outputs the current temperature (given a count of cricket chirps in a minute) to the nearest tenth degree in both Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales.  Be sure to include an appropriate statement as to the severity of the temperature. 

Temperature		Severity
109 and up		Dead Cricket
81 to 108		Whew
65 to 80		Ah-hhh
45 to 64		Take a Jacket
less then 45		Bur-rrr
