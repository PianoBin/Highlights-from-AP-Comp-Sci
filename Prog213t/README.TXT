PROGRAM 213t
(National Parcel Services)

Program Description:  National Parcel Services (NPS) specializes in nationwide delivery of small packages.   NPS will not accept any package whose largest dimension is greater than 3 feet or whose weight exceeds 50 pounds.  The charge for shipping a parcel is $0.75 plus an amount based on package weight as follows:

	Weight (lbs)				Rate
	
	20 or less				$0.08 per lb.
	over 20 but 40 or less			$0.10 per lb.
	over 40					$0.15 per lb.

There is an additional $1.00 charge if the volume of the package exceeds 18 cubic feet.  Write a program that will read the dimensions of a parcel (in feet) and its weight (in pounds) and then compute and print the postage due.  If the package is rejected, an appropriate message should be printed.  Each line of data in the external file consists of four decimal numbers.
