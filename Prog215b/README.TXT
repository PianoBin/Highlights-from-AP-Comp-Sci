(faster than a speeding bullet) 

Program Description:  A rifle has a muzzle velocity of 960 feet per second.  If it were fired vertically upward, what would be the maximum height attained by the bullet?  If time is expressed in T seconds, then the distance the bullet travels would be 960T feet, minus the pull of gravity, which is 16T2.  Thus, the height h could be found by the formula 

h=960t - 16t2.

Write a program that computes h until it stops getting larger and you have the maximum height.  Print out only the maximum height that the bullet attains and print out the number of seconds it takes to attain that height. A test for up to sixty seconds should be sufficient.
