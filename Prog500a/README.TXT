Program 500a
(Mr. Ascii)

Program Description:  A computer recognizes characters as a numerical value from an ASCII table.  The majority of the printable charters appear in the range of 32 (a space) to 122(lower case z). [this should fit in your output window.]  Since these values are ordinal you may use them as your initial, test and increment in a for loop.  The output from the following program segment illustrates this point.  

Print out a table of all characters in the range of “space” to “z” and their associated ascii values.
