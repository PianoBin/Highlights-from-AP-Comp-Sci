(foolin’ around with strings)

Program Description:  One of your classmates just wrote a program that continuously scrolls a line of text vertically on the screen.  You think it would be a lot “cooler” to have a program that asks for some text and then repeats it once for every character in the line of text.  You are amazed that it was so easy to accomplish with the right tools.

Statements Required:  input, output, loop control, strings, and string methods

Sample Output:  (Be sure you run at least 3 test cases!)
The length of your word is 5 characters.
