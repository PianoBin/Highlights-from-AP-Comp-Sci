Program 671a
{time converter}


Program Description: You have just been hired by a company to do it’s weekly payroll.  One of the functions you must perform daily is to check the employee time cards and compute the elapsed time between the time they “punch in” and “punch out”.  You also have to sometimes convert hours to minutes, days to hours, minutes to hours and hours to days.  Since you’ve just finished your first programming class you decide to write a program that will help you do your job.

You decide to structure your program the following way.  The main function will just be a menu that the user can select from to get the information they want.  Each option on the menu will call a specific method(s) to solve the task and/or output the answer. 

You may assume for this program that all elapsed times will be in a single day but the others may span much further.  Be sure to provide sufficient test data to demonstrate that your solutions are correct. (show at least one output for each conversion [probably several for option #5]). 

Be sure to provide reasonable error checking on the times.
